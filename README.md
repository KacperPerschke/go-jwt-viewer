# go-jwt-viewer
Shows content of JSON Web Token

## Rationale
Some enterprises are afraid to use a [publicly available JWT decoder](https://jwt.io/) even if the token they want to check is generated in a test environment.
I hope this program can meet your need for a private decoder.

## Comment
I see one obstruction.
1. My knowledge of JWT is very little.
